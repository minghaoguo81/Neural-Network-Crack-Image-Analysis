Build neural network using MLP, simple CNN, and Resnet model

In this project, we study a dataset containing images of various concrete surfaces with and
without crack. The images are divided into two classes as negative (without crack) and positive
(with crack). There are in total 32137 images for training with 227 x 227 pixels with RGB
channels (16070 images in the positive class and 16037 images in the negative class)
Visual crack inspection and detection plays a major role in building inspection and is a widely
used method for determining the building health. The goal is to build a model to detect a crack for
the test set. For each image in the test set, you must predict whether or not there is a crack (Positive
or Negative) and submit your results on Blackboard by 11:39 PM on Friday 12/15. You need to
submit a csv file with two columns: image_id and set and predicted_class.
